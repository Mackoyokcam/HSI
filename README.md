Housing Sustainability Index

I added a basic hello world skeleton to get running on the server. Note that
I downloaded flask through virtualenv on the linux subsystem for windows, so
it might be a good idea to delete and reaquire it on whatever server we get
(some C extensions couldn't be aquired so it's just python right now
according to the install messages).

"chmod a+x run.py", then "./run.py" then open localhost:5000/ to view the app

alternatively you can "flask/bin/python run.py" if you don't want .pyc files.
